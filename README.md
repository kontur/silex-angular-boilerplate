# Silex / Angular boilerplate
This is a *(very opinionated and static)* boilerplate codebase for setting up a Angular application with a Silex backend. 
It is a collection of personal preferences and patterns set up to get off the ground quickly by avoiding common
installation and bootstrapping tasks.
 
Note that while you are welcome to use this setup in any way you like, this is mostly for my personal reference and 
there is no cohesive documentation or instructions.

## What's included
* composer, bower, npm set up ready to install
* gruntfile configured for javascript and less compilation
* angular bootstrap app (with some cheat-sheet type of controllers, services, etc. definitions)
* silex bootstrap app (to serve angular wrapper, api endpoints and crud admin interface)
